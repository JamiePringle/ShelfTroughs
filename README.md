# ShelfTroughs
Code and data for JGR/oceans paper: "Glacial Troughs Enhance Shelf/Slope Exchange in the Barotropic Limit" by Hampson and Pringle.

In the directory Figures resides the data to makes figures 3 and 5, and the instructions to make figures 1 through 6 from the model code.

In the modelCode directory is the code that solves for the barotropic, linear flow over a shelf-trough as discussed in [Insert publication data when available]. Instructions for configuring and running the model are given in the README_main.txt
